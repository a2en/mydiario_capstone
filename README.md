# mydiario_capstone

My diario is a simple diary app which allows users to create an account and save their daily diary
entry in the cloud. The app also allows you to add your current location to the diary entry 

This app demonstrates the following views and techniques:

* [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) to make api calls to an HTTP web service
* [Moshi](https://github.com/square/moshi) which handles the deserialization of the returned JSON to Kotlin data objects


It leverages the following components from the Jetpack library:

* [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel)
* [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata)
* [Data Binding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding/) with binding adapters
* [Navigation](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/navigation/) with the SafeArgs plugin for parameter passing between fragments
